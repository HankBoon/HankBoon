# Welcome to my Github

My name is Hauke and I am learning to code. 
I started to learn coding in spring 2024, already made a small web app and right now I am attending a bootcamp at **Neue Fische**.

I am a fan of all kinds of nerdy stuff like:
- PC Gaming
- Warhammer
- Science-Fiction
  
Thats also what my app is about!
